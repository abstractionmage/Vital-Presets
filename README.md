All the presets I ever made for Vital. Have fun using them :)

## How to install

1. Download this repository into your Vital Preset directory (and unzip it to a folder if necessary). The preset directory can be found under `%UserProfile%\Documents\Vital` on Microsoft Windows, `Library/Audio/Presets/Vital` on MacOS and `~/.local/share/vital` on Linux.
2. Rename the downloaded folder to `AbstractionMage`
